				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who are you?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>A gang of brokeass cheapskate students who don't have money but still wants to support their favourite groups (when will our dumbass selves will learn). Different GOs will be handled by different people but I handle the WM/EM delivery.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why are you doing this?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I'm a college student. I don't want to have to pay extra RM30-40 when I could get the albums + poster cheaper and get it sent straight to my house. That's why my friends and I decided to do this, so we could find people to split the EMS fees.</p>
          </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

      <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How many GOs have you done?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>I can't exactly remember.<br><br>

          TWICE Twicetagram<br>NCT 127 Cherry Bomb<br>BTS Love Yourself Her<br>SEVENTEEN Teen.Age<br>Red Velvet The Red Summer<br>Wanna One 1x1=1<br>SNSD Holiday Night (it was over 80 albums)<br>Taeyeon PERSONA Photobook<br> and the list goes on.<br><br>

          This doesn't even include the normal GOs where you are allowed to order any albums you like.</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>I'm sorry. I must've been too busy or I do not wish to get spammed with unnecessary questions. My Carousell inbox is strictly for my buyers. Please ask me <a href="https://curiouscat.me/squishyshazzy/" target="_blank">here</a> instead. I'll try to answer them as many as I can.</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>GO REQUESTS</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you accept GO requests?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Depends on:<br><br>
  1. If it's a popular group. Popular groups have a lot of volunteers who are willing to handle the GO. In this case, I will back off and let their actual fans do it.<br>
  2. If people do it at non-profit price. If I see someone else doing it at a non-profit price, I will usually forward you to them so you can join theirs instead.<br>
  3. If I'm busy. I'm a full time fourth year Pharmacy student which means I don't have a lot of time in my hand to focus on GOs.

  Please request <a href="https://curiouscat.me/squishyshazzy/" target="_blank">here</a> instead. I'd like to keep my Carousell inbox as clutter free as I can.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If it's not stated in the listing and the status of my GO is full/closed, then I won't do it. 90% of the time I will only open 1 batch for each comeback GO because I'm too lazy. <p>

      <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When's your next GO?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>Please refrain from spamming me with this question. There's so many things that I need to consider. I need to consider the probability of the albums getting detained if I do two GOs at the same time. I also need to allocate time to find people to join, update you guys on albums' whereabouts, calculating second payment and packing your albums. It's not exactly easy to manage a GO, especially one where you barely get a profit. I literally gain nothing from doing this GO. So, please. Next time you want to ask me this question, please consider things from my perspectives.<br><br>

          If you cannot wait, maybe you can find someone else to manage a GO for you instead.

          If you ask me this question 3 times in a row after I've repeatedly told you not to, I will block you. </p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's a GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>A group order.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's EMS?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>It's an international courier (like DHL, GDex etc). EMS fees is the fee to ship your album from Korea to my house in Malaysia.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why must you do a GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>(UPDATE 9th July) EMS price has effectively increased. Please check here for more info: https://carousell.com/p/115457781/ Base surcharge of EMS has increased to RM29, instead of RM25.<br><br>

EMS has a base surcharge (the minimum fee) of RM25. Imagine your album is 0.3kg and you pay RM25 just for delivery. However, as you add in more albums, the EMS price increase about RM7-11/album. You'll get it like this:<br>
ðŸŒ‘ 1 album = RM25<br>
ðŸŒ‘ 8 albums = RM80 (RM10/album)<br><br>
This is why I decided to do a group order, so that we all can get our albums at a cheaper price.</p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

      <li>
    <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why is your price so cheap compared to others?</a>
    <div class="cd-faq-content">
      <p>That's because the price is the original album price. I haven't include the second payment yet.</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
  </li>
      
  <li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's in the second payment?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
  <p>EMS fees + WM/EM postage fees + packing (bubble wraps + flyers) + poster tubes + customs fees (if any).</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>		
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How much is the EMS fees per album?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>EMS is based on weight. Do you want the EMS fees to be split (RM80 total, 7 people = RM12/person) equally among us when your album is 0.3kg and someone else is 0.7kg, meaning you'll basically pay extra for their albums? No, right? Hence, why I will weigh the albums AFTER it arrives my house. <br><br>
  
  For a GO of a certain comeback album, the EMS will be split equally because they basically have the same weights.</p>
  </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you charge anything?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Previously, no. Right now, I charge RM3 for packing + bubble wraps + flyers. You might think it's expensive but when you get the total price of first + second payment (inclusive of my charge), you'll realize that you still get it cheaper than the KPop shops out there.<br><br>
  Plus a very secure packaging.</p>
  </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What proof do you have that it's non-profit?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        <p>If the album is RM46.60, of course I will round it off to RM47. RM0.40 x 9 albums per GO = RM3.60. RM4-5 per GO hardly counts as a profit be honest, considering I have to find people to join the GO, being asked repeated questions, dealing with backout buyers, going to customs and wrapping up your albums securely. </p>
      </div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What if it gets detained by customs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        <p>Then the custom fees will be divided equally. You'll also have to pay for my toll + fuels. It's usually around RM2-5/album. Also, my GOs very rarely get detained because I know of ways to avoid them. </p>
      </div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are there many types of GOs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        <p>Yes, there is. Normal GO is where I will accept all kinds of albums from any groups while a (name of KPop Group) GO is where I do GO for a specific album by that group, usually their comeback album (eg: NCT 127 - Cherry Bomb GO).</p>
        </div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

      <li>
      <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Where do your order your albums?</a>
      <div class="cd-faq-content">
      <p>Synnara. </p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
      </li>

      <li>
      <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will my order count in Hanteo Chart?</a>
      <div class="cd-faq-content">
      <p>Synnara is an official online Korean music store (like Speedy). Your orders will always count in Hanteo.</p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
      </li>

      <li>
      <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I get Synnara receipts?</a>
      <div class="cd-faq-content">
      <p>Yes, please requests this from me.</p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
      </li>

      <li>
    <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long does it take for my album to arrive to your house?</a>
    <div class="cd-faq-content">
    <p>3-4 days for Synnara to process the order and 3 days for it to arrive MY. But I'll set it as 1-2 weeks.</p></div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
  </li>

  <li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are the albums sealed?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, they are brand new/genuine/official and sealed with photocards intact. I won't touch it.</p>
</div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What if my album is a pre-order album and you didn't make a GO for that album?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>I pre-ordered countless of albums before. If you want to pre-order an album and join a normal GO, you NEED to tell me because other people will have to wait for YOUR albums to be released in Korea first and that'll delay the shipment. I need to inform them if they're willing to wait.</p>
</div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">My album has a pre-order benefit and I need you to order it ASAP to secure it!</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>This is common for JYP artists. Yes, I will close it early which is why I need everyone to cooperate and make deposit as soon as you can, regardless of the deadline.</p>
</div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will you do an internal trading?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Depends. <br><br>
  
  NOTE: For those who don't know, internal trading is when I unseal your album, along with others and trade the photocard amongst yourselves with your permission, based on your preferred/favorite member. It's based on availability and priority to who pays first. Please note that I will only touch the photocard, nothing else. I can't guarantee you will get who you want.</p>
</div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I order posters? What about poster tubes?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, but I can't guarantee that I can find you a poster tube. </p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>
						

			
						
<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will you wrap my albums carefully?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes. My feedbacks say it all. I am very particular with packaging. Your album will always be wrapped thickly for maximum protection.</p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is there a deadline for this?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Deadlines are always stated on each listing. Different GOs have different deadlines.</p>

              <div class="cd-faq-content">
              <p>Most of the times, no. But sometimes I buy extras just to fill in the batch. If I do, I will upload a separate listing to sell the extras. Do note that you will not get it at the same price if you join my GO in the first place. The people who joined my GOs find it unfair if I do that because they had to rush to pay and secure their slots while you can buy it at ready stock.</p>

              <div class="cd-faq-content">
              <p>No. It wasn't easy for me to find one and I'm not going to disclose it anytime soon.</p>

              <p>Yese, I'll try my best. Please ask me at my curiouscat. I do provide service to help find photocards to save shipping when I want to buy some.

						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the rules that I need to know before I join the GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>You are not allowed to:<br>
        
<br>1. Resell the albums to make a profit. I will IMMEDIATELY BLOCK you if I find out. 

<br>2. Resell the photocards at a higher price. E.g: you bought the album from me for RM60 WM but you sell the photocards for RM40 and RM30. I see a lot of people doing this.

<br>3. Demand and be rude to me. You are in no position to demand. I will only take orders from NICE AND POLITE PEOPLE. I'm doing this for free/very low charge, so I would appreciate some basic courtesy and respect. I swear to God, I don't know how KPop sellers handle rude customers. So much respect to them.

<br>4. Backout. Once you are committed, you HAVE to pay the EMS fees, however much it is.

<br>5. NO REFUNDS ARE ALLOWED. I'm not a KPop seller, I don't want to have to go through the process of re-selling your albums when it's your mistake in the first place. Otherwise, I would've open a business.

<br>6. PAY AFTER PAYMENT DUE DATE because I will immediately proceed with order after the due date. So, hopefully, you will be alert and pay on time. Any late payment after order will 100% be refunded.

<br><br>

You are allowed to:<br><br>
1. Pull out from the order if you haven't paid yet. I don't mind but please let me know beforehand (like 2-3 days) before the GO close so I could find others to join.
<br>
2. Reserve your slots by MAKING AN OFFER OF (album price) to me so that I know you're committed to the GO. I also need to reject any potential member so please, make an offer. Reservation will be automatically cancelled after 3 days if payment is not made. 
<br>
3. Pay immediately. I really welcome members who pays immediately. I can breathe easier if I can close the GO ASAP, so I don't have to worry about last minute backouts, finding new members and dealing with them. </p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
