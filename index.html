<h2>Basics</h2>
</li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who are you?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>A gang of brokeass cheapskate students who don't have money but still wants to support their favourite groups (when will our dumbass selves will learn). Different GOs will be handled by different people but I handle the WM/EM delivery.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why are you doing this?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>I'm a college student. I don't want to have to pay extra RM30-40 when I could get the albums + poster cheaper and get it sent straight to my house. That's why my friends and I decided to do this, so we could find people to split the EMS fees.</p>

<h2>GO REQUESTS</h2>
</li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you accept GO requests?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Depends on:<br><br>
  1. If it's a popular group. Popular groups have a lot of volunteers who are willing to handle the GO. In this case, I will back off and let their actual fans do it.<br>
  2. If people do it at non-profit price. If I see someone else doing it at a non-profit price, I will usually forward you to them so you can join theirs instead.<br>
  3. If I'm busy. I'm a full time fourth year Pharmacy student which means I don't have a lot of time in my hand to focus on GOs.</p>

<h2>GO FAQS</h2>
</li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's a GO?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>A group order.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's EMS?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>It's an internation courier (like DHL, GDex etc). EMS fees is the fee to ship your album from Korea to my house in Malaysia.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Why must you do a GO?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>(UPDATE 9th July) EMS price has effectively increased. Please check here for more info: https://carousell.com/p/115457781/ Base surcharge of EMS has increased to RM29, instead of RM25.<br><br>

EMS has a base surcharge (the minimum fee) of RM25. Imagine your album is 0.3kg and you pay RM25 just for delivery. However, as you add in more albums, the EMS price increase about RM7-11/album. You'll get it like this:<br>
ðŸŒ‘ 1 album = RM25<br>
ðŸŒ‘ 8 albums = RM80 (RM10/album)<br>
This is why I decided to do a group order, so that we all can get our albums at a cheaper price.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How much is the EMS fees per album?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>EMS is based on weight. Do you want the EMS fees to be split (RM80 total, 7 people = RM12/person) equally among us when your album is 0.3kg and someone else is 0.7kg, meaning you'll basically pay extra for their albums? No, right? Hence, why I will weigh the albums AFTER it arrives my house. <br><br>
  
  For a GO of a certain comeback album, the EMS will be split equally because they basically have the same weights.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you charge anything?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Previously, no. Right now, I charge RM3 for packing + bubble wraps + flyers. You might think it's expensive but when you get the total price of first + second payment (inclusive of my charge), you'll realize that you still get it cheaper than the KPop shops out there.<br><br>
  Plus a very secure packaging.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What proof do you have that it's non-profit?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>If the album is RM46.60, of course I will round it off to RM47. RM0.40 x 9 albums per GO = RM3.60. RM4-5 per GO hardly counts as a profit be honest, considering I have to find people to join the GO, being asked repeated questions, dealing with backout buyers, going to customs and wrapping up your albums securely. </p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What if it gets detained by customs.</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Then the custom fees will be divided equally. You'll also have to pay for my toll + fuels. It's usually around RM2-5/album. Also, my GOs very rarely get detained because I know of ways to avoid them. </p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"></a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>EMS is the international shipping fee to ship your goods from Korean to TUMY in Malaysia. EMS fee will be divided equally by the number of orders we receive. The more people join, the lower the EMS fees. This is because EMS has a very high base fee. However, as the weight increases, the price will only increase a few USD.</p>

<h2>SNSD albums</h2>
</li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I order SNSD albums? Do you have them ready stock?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, you may. All SNSD albums are on a pre-order basis only. We do not have any in hand.<br /><br /> NOTE: SM has officially stopped the production for Tiffany's I Just Wanna Dance album. TUMY will no longer accept order for this album.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long does it take for the album to reach me?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>It depends. In order to maintain a cheap price for all of the albums, TUMY requires a certain quantity in each batch before we order. This is to reduce the EMS fees each person has to pay. This means you might have to wait a while for the batch to be full. After albums are ordered, it takes 2 weeks for them to reach TUMY.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How many albums can I order?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>As long as the albums are availabe in Synnara, we accept all orders regardless of the quantity.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I also order Jessica's solo albums from you?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, you may.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Any second payment? What if it gets detained by customs?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Unless the albums are detained by customs, there will be no second payment. If the albums are detained, we will inform you through email for you to make payment. However, it's very rare for our albums to be detained by customs as we always maintain a certain limit.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I order posters? What about poster tubes?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Most of SNSD albums do not have posters unless the album is by a solo member (Taeyeon, Tiffany, Seohyun, Jessica). Poster tubes are limited. In case poster tubes are unavailable, we will send the poster to you folded.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is there a deadline for this?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>SNSD albums will not have a deadline. As long as SONEs want to order it, TUMY will always accept orders.</p>

<h2>ORDERING and PAYMENTS</h2>
</li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Alright, I'm interested! How do I join the GO?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>TUMY will always attach an order Google form for you to fill it. Each GO has its own specific info (deadline, pricing, ETA, banking details). Please go through all the info carefully before you join. Below is the common procedure for the GO: <br /><br /> 1. Please make your payment into the bank account stated in the GO. Some GOs will have different banking details as it will be handled by different admins in order to avoid confusion. <br />2. If you're using online transfer, PLEASE include this email: taeyeonfanunionmy@gmail.com if prompted in the recipient email when making online banking transfer. <br />3. Fill in this form. Please immediately fill in the form after you've made payment or you might forget to fill it. <br />4. Wait for 24-48 hours for TUMY to confirm that we've received your payment. <br />5. We will send out deposit payment confirmation.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What bank do you use?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Maybank.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I'm overseas right now but I would like to join the GO. Can I make payment through PayPal?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, you may. Please DM us for TUMY's PayPal details. Kindly cover the G&amp;S fees and deposit ONLY in USD. This is because fansites only accept in USD. Do note that if you're not in overseas, it's better to make payment through local bank.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Oh, no! I missed the deadline and the order form is closed. Can I still order?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>No. TUMY is very puntual with deadline. We will always give out the time and date of deadline for each GO. We will not entertain any latecomers.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I'm scared the EMS fee will be expensive. Can I know how many people have ordered?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Please check <a href="https://goo.gl/kSQ5PU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. After every order filled, we will always update the status so that people have an inkling of how much they need to pay for EMS.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I've filled in the form and made payment! What's next?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>The only thing you can do now is wait and TUMY will handle everything. We will update you by your email throughout the whole process. <br /><br /> Example, we will:<br /> 1. Provide you with proof of payment to fansite masternim<br /> 2. Update you once fansite masternim has shipped out your goods.<br /> 3. Update you again once we've received the item.<br /> 4. Send out second payment email once we've calculated the EMS + PayPal + local postage fees <br /> 5. Update you with tracking number.</p>

<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I've waited for 2 days and I still haven't received a comfirmation email.</a>

<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can you update me on X GO?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">

<h2>Delivery</h2>
</li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What courier do you use?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>We use Poslaju as our main courier. However, we do have other options such as SkyNet for heavy parcels. This is because SkyNet is generally cheaper for heavy parcels.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">My item came damaged!</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>TUMY always ensure that each item is packed carefully and with many layers of bubble wraps for maximum protection. Once we give your parcel to the courier, it is out of our hands if the items are damaged.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's taking so long for you to ship my parcel?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>We're very sorry for this but we hope you understand from our part. The admins of TUMY are all full-time college students. There are days that our schedules will be packed and we do not have the time to post your parcel. However, we will try our best to post them as soon as we can.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's EasyParcel?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>We use EasyParcel to post items in bulk. It's easier for us because EasyParcel will schedule a pick-up on our behalf and we also find EasyParcel faster than manually posting it over the counter.</p>
</div>
<!-- cd-faq-content --></li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">You said EasyParcel is faster but why isn't my parcel being picked-up yet?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Sometimes Poslaju will cancel pick-up if there is a heavy rain or if they're too busy to pick up the parcels and have to reschedule to tomorrow. TUMY cannot do anything about this as it is out of our hands. We can only report this to EasyParcel so that they can urge Poslaju to pick-up the items faster.</p>

<h2>K-WAVE 2.0 FUNDRAISE &amp; FAN PROJECT</h2>
</li>
<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I heard you're doing a fan project/backstage support. Can you explain more?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>TUMY will not disclose this until we reach our target for the fundraising project. This is because TUMY needs to have money in order to kickstart the fan project and we cannot discuss about the fan project if we do not have the necessary funds to start the fan project. TUMY's main priority right now is to sell the fankits. Once we reach our limit for the fankit, then we can talk about a possibility of a fan project/backstage support. Kindly be reminded that the admins of TUMY are all college students, so you cannot expect us to fund the fan project with our own money. We hope this question will not arise again until we make official announcements about it.</p>

<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>TUMY will sell fankits for the K-Wave 2.0 concert. All item in the fankit is designed by TUMY carefully and with that money, we plan to make a fan project/backstage support.</p>

<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I self-collect the fankit on the concert day?</a>
