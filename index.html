				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who are you?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>A gang of brokeass cheapskate students who don't have money but still wants to support their favourite groups (when will our dumbass selves will learn). Different GOs will be handled by different people but I handle the WM/EM delivery.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why are you doing this?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I'm a college student. I don't want to have to pay extra RM30-40 when I could get the albums + poster cheaper and get it sent straight to my house. That's why my friends and I decided to do this, so we could find people to split the EMS fees.</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>GO REQUESTS</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you accept GO requests?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Depends on:<br><br>
  1. If it's a popular group. Popular groups have a lot of volunteers who are willing to handle the GO. In this case, I will back off and let their actual fans do it.<br>
  2. If people do it at non-profit price. If I see someone else doing it at a non-profit price, I will usually forward you to them so you can join theirs instead.<br>
  3. If I'm busy. I'm a full time fourth year Pharmacy student which means I don't have a lot of time in my hand to focus on GOs.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's a GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>A group order.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's EMS?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>It's an international courier (like DHL, GDex etc). EMS fees is the fee to ship your album from Korea to my house in Malaysia.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why must you do a GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>(UPDATE 9th July) EMS price has effectively increased. Please check here for more info: https://carousell.com/p/115457781/ Base surcharge of EMS has increased to RM29, instead of RM25.<br><br>

EMS has a base surcharge (the minimum fee) of RM25. Imagine your album is 0.3kg and you pay RM25 just for delivery. However, as you add in more albums, the EMS price increase about RM7-11/album. You'll get it like this:<br>
ðŸŒ‘ 1 album = RM25<br>
ðŸŒ‘ 8 albums = RM80 (RM10/album)<br><br>
This is why I decided to do a group order, so that we all can get our albums at a cheaper price.</p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How much is the EMS fees per album?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>EMS is based on weight. Do you want the EMS fees to be split (RM80 total, 7 people = RM12/person) equally among us when your album is 0.3kg and someone else is 0.7kg, meaning you'll basically pay extra for their albums? No, right? Hence, why I will weigh the albums AFTER it arrives my house. <br><br>
  
  For a GO of a certain comeback album, the EMS will be split equally because they basically have the same weights.</p>
  </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you charge anything?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Previously, no. Right now, I charge RM3 for packing + bubble wraps + flyers. You might think it's expensive but when you get the total price of first + second payment (inclusive of my charge), you'll realize that you still get it cheaper than the KPop shops out there.<br><br>
  Plus a very secure packaging.</p>
  </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What proof do you have that it's non-profit?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        <p>If the album is RM46.60, of course I will round it off to RM47. RM0.40 x 9 albums per GO = RM3.60. RM4-5 per GO hardly counts as a profit be honest, considering I have to find people to join the GO, being asked repeated questions, dealing with backout buyers, going to customs and wrapping up your albums securely. </p>
      </div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What if it gets detained by customs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        <p>Then the custom fees will be divided equally. You'll also have to pay for my toll + fuels. It's usually around RM2-5/album. Also, my GOs very rarely get detained because I know of ways to avoid them. </p>
      </div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is there many types of GOs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        <p>Yes, there is. Normal GO is where I will accept all kinds of albums from any groups while a (name of KPop Group) GO is where I do GO for a specific album by that group, usually their comeback album (eg: NCT 127 - Cherry Bomb GO).</p>
        </div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

      <li>
    <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long does it take for my album to arrive to your house?</a>
    <div class="cd-faq-content">
    <p>3-4 days for Synnara to process the order and 3 days for it to arrive MY. But I'll set it as 1-2 weeks.</p></div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
  </li>

  <li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are the albums sealed?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, they are brand new/genuine/official and sealed with photocards intact. I won't touch it. Your orders will all be counted in Hanteo chart because I bought it from Synnara.</p>
</div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What if my album is a pre-order album and you didn't make a GO for that album?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>I pre-ordered countless of albums before. If you want to pre-order an album and join a normal GO, you NEED to tell me because other people will have to wait for YOUR albums to be released in Korea first and that'll delay the shipment. I need to inform them if they're willing to wait.</p>
</div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will you do an internal trading?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Depends. <br><br>
  
  NOTE: For those who don't know, internal trading is when I unseal your album, along with others and trade the photocard amongst yourselves with your permission, based on your preferred/favorite member. It's based on availability and priority to who pays first. Please note that I will only touch the photocard, nothing else. I can't guarantee you will get who you want.</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>RULES</h2></li>
			
						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the rules that I need to knonw before I join the GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>You are not allowed to:<br><br>
          <blockquote>
<br>1. Resell the albums to make a profit. I will IMMEDIATELY BLOCK you if I find out. 

<br>2. Resell the photocards at a higher price. E.g: you bought the album from me for RM60 WM but you sell the photocards for RM40 and RM30. I see a lot of people doing this.

<br>3. Demand and be rude to me. You are in no position to demand. I will only take orders from NICE AND POLITE PEOPLE. I'm doing this for free/very low charge, so I would appreciate some basic courtesy and respect. I swear to God, I don't know how KPop sellers handle rude customers. So much respect to them.

<br>4. Backout. Once you are committed, you HAVE to pay the EMS fees, however much it is.

<br>5. NO REFUNDS ARE ALLOWED. I'm not a KPop seller, I don't want to have to go through the process of re-selling your albums when it's your mistake in the first place. Otherwise, I would've open a business.

<br>6. PAY AFTER PAYMENT DUE DATE because I will immediately proceed with order after the due date. So, hopefully, you will be alert and pay on time. Any late payment after order will 100% be refunded.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
<blockquote>
You are allowed to:<br><br>
1. Pull out from the order if you haven't paid yet. I don't mind but please let me know beforehand (like 2-3 days) before the GO close so I could find others to join.
<br>
2. Reserve your slots by MAKING AN OFFER OF (album price) to me so that I know you're committed to the GO. I also need to reject any potential member so please, make an offer. Reservation will be automatically cancelled after 3 days if payment is not made. 
<br>
3. Pay immediately. I really welcome members who pays immediately. I can breathe easier if I can close the GO ASAP, so I don't have to worry about last minute backouts, finding new members and dealing with them. </p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</blockquote></li>
			
						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long does it take for the album to reach me?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>It depends. In order to maintain a cheap price for all of the albums, TUMY requires a certain quantity in each batch before we order. This is to reduce the EMS fees each person has to pay. This means you might have to wait a while for the batch to be full. After albums are ordered, it takes 2 weeks for them to reach TUMY.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How many albums can I order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>As long as the albums are availabe in Synnara, we accept all orders regardless of the quantity.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I also order Jessica's solo albums from you?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, you may.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Any second payment? What if it gets detained by customs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Unless the albums are detained by customs, there will be no second payment. If the albums are detained, we will inform you through email for you to make payment. However, it's very rare for our albums to be detained by customs as we always maintain a certain limit.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I order posters? What about poster tubes?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Most of SNSD albums do not have posters unless the album is by a solo member (Taeyeon, Tiffany, Seohyun, Jessica). Poster tubes are limited. In case poster tubes are unavailable, we will send the poster to you folded.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is there a deadline for this?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>SNSD albums will not have a deadline. As long as SONEs want to order it, TUMY will always accept orders.</p>

						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Alright, I'm interested! How do I join the GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>TUMY will always attach an order Google form for you to fill it. Each GO has its own specific info (deadline, pricing, ETA, banking details). Please go through all the info carefully before you join. Below is the common procedure for the GO:
					<br><br>
					1. Please make your payment into the bank account stated in the GO. Some GOs will have different banking details as it will be handled by different admins in order to avoid confusion.
					<br>2. If you're using online transfer, PLEASE include this email: taeyeonfanunionmy@gmail.com if prompted in the recipient email when making online banking transfer.
					<br>3. Fill in this form. Please immediately fill in the form after you've made payment or you might forget to fill it.
					<br>4. Wait for 24-48 hours for TUMY to confirm that we've received your payment.
					<br>5. We will send out deposit payment confirmation.</p>

			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I'm overseas right now but I would like to join the GO. Can I make payment through PayPal?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, you may. Please DM us for TUMY's PayPal details. Kindly cover the G&S fees and deposit ONLY in USD. This is because fansites only accept in USD. Do note that if you're not in overseas, it's better to make payment through local bank.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Oh, no! I missed the deadline and the order form is closed. Can I still order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No. TUMY is very puntual with deadline. We will always give out the time and date of deadline for each GO. We will not entertain any latecomers.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I'm scared the EMS fee will be expensive. Can I know how many people have ordered?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Please check <a href="https://goo.gl/kSQ5PU" target="_blank">here</a>. After every order filled, we will always update the status so that people have an inkling of how much they need to pay for EMS.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I've filled in the form and made payment! What's next?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The only thing you can do now is wait and TUMY will handle everything. We will update you by your email throughout the whole process.
					<br><br>
					Example, we will:<br>
					1. Provide you with proof of payment to fansite masternim<br>
					2. Update you once fansite masternim has shipped out your goods.<br>
					3. Update you again once we've received the item.<br>
					4. Send out second payment email once we've calculated the EMS + PayPal + local postage fees <br>
					5. Update you with tracking number.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What courier do you use?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>We use Poslaju as our main courier. However, we do have other options such as SkyNet for heavy parcels. This is because SkyNet is generally cheaper for heavy parcels.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">My item came damaged!</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>TUMY always ensure that each item is packed carefully and with many layers of bubble wraps for maximum protection. Once we give your parcel to the courier, it is out of our hands if the items are damaged.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's taking so long for you to ship my parcel?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>We're very sorry for this but we hope you understand from our part. The admins of TUMY are all full-time college students. There are days that our schedules will be packed and we do not have the time to post your parcel. However, we will try our best to post them as soon as we can.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's EasyParcel?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>We use EasyParcel to post items in bulk. It's easier for us because EasyParcel will schedule a pick-up on our behalf and we also find EasyParcel faster than manually posting it over the counter. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">You said EasyParcel is faster but why isn't my parcel being picked-up yet?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Sometimes Poslaju will cancel pick-up if there is a heavy rain or if they're too busy to pick up the parcels and have to reschedule to tomorrow. TUMY cannot do anything about this as it is out of our hands. We can only report this to EasyParcel so that they can urge Poslaju to pick-up the items faster.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>TUMY will not disclose this until we reach our target for the fundraising project. This is because TUMY needs to have money in order to kickstart the fan project and we cannot discuss about the fan project if we do not have the necessary funds to start the fan project. TUMY's main priority right now is to sell the fankits. Once we reach our limit for the fankit, then we can talk about a possibility of a fan project/backstage support. Kindly be reminded that the admins of TUMY are all college students, so you cannot expect us to fund the fan project with our own money.
