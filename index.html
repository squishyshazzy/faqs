				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who are you?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>A gang of brokeass cheapskate students who don't have money but still wants to support their favourite groups (when will our dumbass selves will learn). Different GOs will be handled by different people but I handle the WM/EM delivery.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why are you doing this?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I'm a college student. I don't want to have to pay extra RM30-40 when I could get the albums + poster cheaper and get it sent straight to my house. That's why my friends and I decided to do this, so we could find people to split the EMS fees.</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>GO REQUESTS</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you accept GO requests?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Depends on:<br><br>
  1. If it's a popular group. Popular groups have a lot of volunteers who are willing to handle the GO. In this case, I will back off and let their actual fans do it.<br>
  2. If people do it at non-profit price. If I see someone else doing it at a non-profit price, I will usually forward you to them so you can join theirs instead.<br>
  3. If I'm busy. I'm a full time fourth year Pharmacy student which means I don't have a lot of time in my hand to focus on GOs.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's a GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>A group order.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's EMS?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>It's an international courier (like DHL, GDex etc). EMS fees is the fee to ship your album from Korea to my house in Malaysia.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why must you do a GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>(UPDATE 9th July) EMS price has effectively increased. Please check here for more info: https://carousell.com/p/115457781/ Base surcharge of EMS has increased to RM29, instead of RM25.<br><br>

EMS has a base surcharge (the minimum fee) of RM25. Imagine your album is 0.3kg and you pay RM25 just for delivery. However, as you add in more albums, the EMS price increase about RM7-11/album. You'll get it like this:<br>
ðŸŒ‘ 1 album = RM25<br>
ðŸŒ‘ 8 albums = RM80 (RM10/album)<br><br>
This is why I decided to do a group order, so that we all can get our albums at a cheaper price.</p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

      <li>
    <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why is your price so cheap compared to others?</a>
    <div class="cd-faq-content">
      <p>That's because the price is the original album price. I haven't include the second payment yet.</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
  </li>
      
  <li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's in the second payment??</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
  <p>EMS fees + WM/EM postage fees + packing (bubble wraps + flyers) + poster tubes + customs fees (if any).</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>		
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How much is the EMS fees per album?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>EMS is based on weight. Do you want the EMS fees to be split (RM80 total, 7 people = RM12/person) equally among us when your album is 0.3kg and someone else is 0.7kg, meaning you'll basically pay extra for their albums? No, right? Hence, why I will weigh the albums AFTER it arrives my house. <br><br>
  
  For a GO of a certain comeback album, the EMS will be split equally because they basically have the same weights.</p>
  </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you charge anything?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Previously, no. Right now, I charge RM3 for packing + bubble wraps + flyers. You might think it's expensive but when you get the total price of first + second payment (inclusive of my charge), you'll realize that you still get it cheaper than the KPop shops out there.<br><br>
  Plus a very secure packaging.</p>
  </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What proof do you have that it's non-profit?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        <p>If the album is RM46.60, of course I will round it off to RM47. RM0.40 x 9 albums per GO = RM3.60. RM4-5 per GO hardly counts as a profit be honest, considering I have to find people to join the GO, being asked repeated questions, dealing with backout buyers, going to customs and wrapping up your albums securely. </p>
      </div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What if it gets detained by customs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        <p>Then the custom fees will be divided equally. You'll also have to pay for my toll + fuels. It's usually around RM2-5/album. Also, my GOs very rarely get detained because I know of ways to avoid them. </p>
      </div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is there many types of GOs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        <p>Yes, there is. Normal GO is where I will accept all kinds of albums from any groups while a (name of KPop Group) GO is where I do GO for a specific album by that group, usually their comeback album (eg: NCT 127 - Cherry Bomb GO).</p>
        </div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

      <li>
    <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long does it take for my album to arrive to your house?</a>
    <div class="cd-faq-content">
    <p>3-4 days for Synnara to process the order and 3 days for it to arrive MY. But I'll set it as 1-2 weeks.</p></div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
  </li>

  <li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are the albums sealed?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, they are brand new/genuine/official and sealed with photocards intact. I won't touch it. Your orders will all be counted in Hanteo chart because I bought it from Synnara.</p>
</div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What if my album is a pre-order album and you didn't make a GO for that album?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>I pre-ordered countless of albums before. If you want to pre-order an album and join a normal GO, you NEED to tell me because other people will have to wait for YOUR albums to be released in Korea first and that'll delay the shipment. I need to inform them if they're willing to wait.</p>
</div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will you do an internal trading?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Depends. <br><br>
  
  NOTE: For those who don't know, internal trading is when I unseal your album, along with others and trade the photocard amongst yourselves with your permission, based on your preferred/favorite member. It's based on availability and priority to who pays first. Please note that I will only touch the photocard, nothing else. I can't guarantee you will get who you want.</p>
</div><!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I order posters? What about poster tubes?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Yes, but I can't guarantee that I can find you a poster tube. </p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
</li>

<li>
<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is there a deadline for this?</a>
<div class="cd-faq-content">
<p>Deadlines are always stated on each listing. Different GOs have different deadlines.</p>
</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

		<ul id="rules" class="cd-faq-group">
			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>RULES</h2></li>
			
						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the rules that I need to knonw before I join the GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>You are not allowed to:<br>
        
<br>1. Resell the albums to make a profit. I will IMMEDIATELY BLOCK you if I find out. 

<br>2. Resell the photocards at a higher price. E.g: you bought the album from me for RM60 WM but you sell the photocards for RM40 and RM30. I see a lot of people doing this.

<br>3. Demand and be rude to me. You are in no position to demand. I will only take orders from NICE AND POLITE PEOPLE. I'm doing this for free/very low charge, so I would appreciate some basic courtesy and respect. I swear to God, I don't know how KPop sellers handle rude customers. So much respect to them.

<br>4. Backout. Once you are committed, you HAVE to pay the EMS fees, however much it is.

<br>5. NO REFUNDS ARE ALLOWED. I'm not a KPop seller, I don't want to have to go through the process of re-selling your albums when it's your mistake in the first place. Otherwise, I would've open a business.

<br>6. PAY AFTER PAYMENT DUE DATE because I will immediately proceed with order after the due date. So, hopefully, you will be alert and pay on time. Any late payment after order will 100% be refunded.

<br><br>

You are allowed to:<br><br>
1. Pull out from the order if you haven't paid yet. I don't mind but please let me know beforehand (like 2-3 days) before the GO close so I could find others to join.
<br>
2. Reserve your slots by MAKING AN OFFER OF (album price) to me so that I know you're committed to the GO. I also need to reject any potential member so please, make an offer. Reservation will be automatically cancelled after 3 days if payment is not made. 
<br>
3. Pay immediately. I really welcome members who pays immediately. I can breathe easier if I can close the GO ASAP, so I don't have to worry about last minute backouts, finding new members and dealing with them. </p></div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's EasyParcel?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I use EasyParcel to post albums in bulk. It's easier for me because EasyParcel will schedule a pick-up on my behalf and I also find EasyParcel faster than manually posting it over the counter. Also, the post office near my house does not accept posters + albums to be shipped together.</p>
